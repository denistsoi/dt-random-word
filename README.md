# Poetry Slam Prep

### Description

A CLI random word generator/prompt to prepare for a poetry slam.  

This was inspired by node-rhyme by @substack, but I found that it wasn't working well for me, even though I just needed a random word prompt.

### Getting Started

Prerequistes

    node 4.x.x and above // cause I was using fat arrows  

    git clone github.com/denistsoi/dt-random-word  
    cd dt-random-word  
    npm start
